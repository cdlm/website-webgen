This page could use many blocks from which the home page selects the 3 last (so that it's easy to `cat` new ones at the end)…


###### Still growing
[Jean-Rémy Falleri](http://www.lirmm.fr/~falleri) just joined [RMoD][rmod] as a Post-doc during 2009--2010.


###### New members
[RMoD][] welcomes three new members in 2009: two permanent positions, [Marcus Denker](http://marcusdenker.de) ([Inria][]) and [Nicolas Anquetil](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/nicolas-anquetil/7/a78/9b5) ([USTL][]), and a new Ph.D. student, Jean-Baptiste Arnaud. Cyrille Delaunay, who just finished his masters internship, stays with us as a research engineer.


###### Pharo 1.0 beta
[Pharo][] has reached beta status! The first beta version was released on July 31, 2009; still [lots of work ahead](http://code.google.com/p/pharo/issues/list?q=milestone=1.0), but this certainly is a good milestone towards a full 1.0 release.


###### Pharo by Example
We're adapting [Squeak by Example][sbe] to the new stuff in [Pharo][], and the book will also feature additional chapters. Release due soon.
