This page is here to test and showcase design elements before using them in visible places on this site.[^foot]
{: .highlight}

[^foot]: Such as, Maruku's footnotes[^cool]
[^cool]: Aren't they cute?  
They can take several lines, but only one &para;!

## Testing what headings look like

Lipsum is for dummies, fill this file with your *own* data, **I *mean* it!!!**
{: .right}

<%= lipsum %>

- and a unordered list
- With long items, very very long, much longer than a measly single line can contain, thus wrapping and occupying more vertical space than simple tiny list items like:
  - a subitem
  - and more	
- and back to level one

an ordered list :

1. With long items, very very long, much longer than a measly single line can contain, thus wrapping and occupying more vertical space just like above, except here we have a number.
1. bar

Plus some more text as a quote:
> <%= lipsum %>

### 3rd-level heading
Then some “code”:
    <%= lipsum.gsub '. ', ".\n    " %>

#### the Fourth-LEVEL header of a test
<%= lipsum %>

##### Fifth-level Title
This one is inline…
<%= lipsum %>

###### Lowest title
This one is not that useful.
<%= lipsum %>

<%= lipsum %>
