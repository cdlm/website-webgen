## Research Area

My research domain is software engineering, more precisely software **evolution**, **reengineering**, and **language design**.
As [Kent Beck writes](http://www.threeriversinstitute.org/blog/?p=363):

> Succession is the price of success. The needs of the design evolve.

I'm interested in making tools to better understand existing software, and to (pro)actively support its evolution though more expressive or simpler programming tools:

- new reverse-engineering, analysis, and visualisation techniques for program comprehension;
- new development tools and more expressive language constructs to build understandable and evolvable programs.

In the context of [RMoD][], I follow these interests in the perspective of modularity and remodularization.
