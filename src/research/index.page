### Research Area

My research domain is software engineering, more precisely software **evolution** and **reengineering**.
I'm interested in making tools to better understand software, and to actively support its evolution:

- new reverse-engineering and visualisation techniques for program comprehension;
- new development tools and more expressive languages to build evolvable programs.
