# {title:}


[Tenuki](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tenuki) is a term from the [game of Go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Go) that denotes ignoring the current local battle and just playing somewhere else.
So these pages will be like a blog or a repository of short writings on various subjects, probably quite geeky but not necessarily entirely related to research or even computer science; in fact, if I had to gather all that will appear here in a book, I would probably entitle it *The Art of Computer Procrastinating*.  


<%
  pages = context.content_node.tree.node_access[:alcn].select{ |alcn,no| alcn =~ /\d{4}\/.*\.blog/ && no.is_file? }
  pages = pages.collect{ |na,no| no}.sort{ |a,b| b['date'] <=> a['date'] }
  pages.each do |node|
%>

### <%= context.dest_node.link_to(node, :link_text => node['routed_title'] || node['title']) %>

<%# node['author'] %>  
<%= node['date'].strftime("%d %b %Y") %>
{: .left}

<%= context.render_block(:name => 'content', :chain => node.alcn) %>
<%= context.dest_node.link_to(node, :link_text => "More") %>
<% end %>

###### Work in progress!
Below is a quick brain dump of things I could write about ---or already have, but need to dig them up--- when I get myself to it (or someone pushes me enough).
{: .banner}

- Typography, graphic design

- LaTeX tips & tricks (setup, workflow, commands, packages)

- unix configuration stuff (svn, seaside with apache/lighttpd ?)

- Go

- Graphics

- Books, Science-fiction, Smalltalk

- Explaining reflection and bootstrap, the neuro-surgeon metaphor

- Misc links like [What To Know Before Debating Type Systems](http://www.pphsg.org/cdsmith/types.html), Dale's [Smalltalk 101](http://gemstonesoup.wordpress.com/smalltalk-101/), Stef's [list of free books](http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks.html), or [general recommendations](http://mleddy.blogspot.com/2005/01/how-to-e-mail-professor.html)

- Machine naming schemes (eldar, cameo/fallawater, tombolimbes, chepa, tenuki, tsuke, hane, keima, komi, kikashi, kakeme, fuseki)
