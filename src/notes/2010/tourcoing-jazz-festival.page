Mid-october is the time for jazz lovers around Lille, with the [Tourcoing Jazz Festival][tjf].
This year it is from Oct. 16th to 23rd, and I suspect whoever invited the artists must have peeked at my music library; I just _had_ to get the whole-week pass.

## Saturday: Renaud García-Fons
[![Renaud García-Fons, La Línea del Sur (2009)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/la-linea-del-sur.jpg)][linea]{: .right}

The festival opened with a concert in Mouscron, near Tourcoing, but on the belgian side of the border, where 5km are more than enough for a poor french driver to get lost…

But I digress :-)

[Renaud García-Fons](http://www.renaudgarciafons.com) is a virtuoso at crossing the colors of mediterranean musics with the fantastic voice of his five-string double bass.
The concert was based on [_La Línea del Sur_][linea], and Renaud was accompanied by David Venitucci (accordion), Kiko Ruis (flamenco guitar), and Sabrina Romero (cajon, vocals, dance).

Sabrina danced flamenco in a couple compositions, answering the three others with the taps of her feet.
I couldn't help but imagine Zakir Hussain conversing with her in ultrafast tabla beats…

## Sunday: Dhafer Youssef, Omar Sosa & Trilok Gurtu
[![Dhafer Youssef, Abu Nawas Rhapsody (2010)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/abu-nawas-rhapsody.jpg)][abunawas]{: .right}

This concert was co-organized by the [Tourcoing Planètes Jazz Festival][tjf] and the [Jazz en Nord Festival][jen], which organizes events along the year.

[Dhafer Youssef](http://www.dhaferyoussef.com/)'s quartet opened this concert in the best way possible, with pieces from his [project dedicated to 8th century poet Abu Nawas][abunawas], intermixing energetic and joyful rhythms with contemplative singing. Wonderful.

- Dhafer Youssef: oud, vocals,
- Tigran Hamasyan: piano,
- Chris Jennings: bass,
- Mark Guiliana: drums.

[![Omar Sosa, Afreecanos (2008)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/afreecanos.jpg)][afreecanos]{: .right}

The second set was [Omar Sosa](http://www.omarsosa.com)'s quartet, plus indian master [Trilok Gurtu](http://www.trilokgurtu.net) as a special guest.
This was clearly more free-form, experimental jazz, incorporating electronics and samples, and under constant moment-to-moment mutation.
Definitely on my to-listen list.

- Omar Sosa: piano, rhodes,
- Trilok Gurtu: tabla, cajon, misc. percussions,
- Childo Thomas: bass guitar, vocals,
- Leandro Saint Hill: soprano & alto saxophones, flute,
- Marque Gilmore: drums.
