Mid-october is the time for jazz lovers around Lille, with the [Tourcoing Jazz Festival][tjf].
This year it is from Oct. 16th to 23rd, and I suspect whoever invited the artists must have peeked at my music library; I just _had_ to get the whole-week pass.

## Saturday: Renaud García-Fons

[![Renaud García-Fons, La Línea del Sur (2009)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/la-linea-del-sur.jpg)][linea]{: .right}

The festival opened with a concert in Mouscron, near Tourcoing, but on the belgian side of the border, where 5km are more than enough for a poor french driver to get lost…

But I digress :-)

[Renaud García-Fons](http://www.renaudgarciafons.com) is a virtuoso at crossing the colors of mediterranean musics with the fantastic voice of his five-string double bass.
The concert was based on [_La Línea del Sur_][linea], and Renaud was accompanied by David Venitucci (accordion), Kiko Ruis (flamenco guitar), and Sabrina Romero (cajon, vocals, dance).

Sabrina danced flamenco in a couple compositions, answering the three others with the taps of her feet.
I couldn't help but imagine Zakir Hussain conversing with her in ultrafast tabla beats…

## Sunday: Dhafer Youssef, Omar Sosa & Trilok Gurtu

[![Dhafer Youssef, Abu Nawas Rhapsody (2010)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/abu-nawas-rhapsody.jpg)][abunawas]{: .right}

[Dhafer Youssef](http://www.dhaferyoussef.com/)'s quartet opened this concert in the best way possible, with pieces from his [project dedicated to 8th century poet Abu Nawas][abunawas], intermixing energetic and joyful rhythms with contemplative singing. Wonderful.
At the piano was an young armenian, [Tigran Hamasyan](http://liveweb.arte.tv/fr/video/Tigran_Hamasyan_au_festival_Souillac_en_Jazz/); now, seeing his already impressive career with Chick Corea or Avishai Cohen, I understand Dhafer when he said he was proud to be part of it.

- Dhafer Youssef: oud, vocals,
- Tigran Hamasyan: piano,
- Chris Jennings: bass,
- Mark Guiliana: drums.

[![Omar Sosa, Afreecanos (2008)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/afreecanos.jpg)][afreecanos]{: .right}

The second set was [Omar Sosa](http://www.omarsosa.com)'s quartet, plus indian master [Trilok Gurtu](http://www.trilokgurtu.net) as a special guest.
This was clearly more free-form, experimental jazz, incorporating electronics and samples, and under constant moment-to-moment mutation.
Definitely on my to-listen list.

- Omar Sosa: piano, rhodes,
- Trilok Gurtu: tabla, cajon, misc. percussions,
- Childo Thomas: bass guitar, vocals,
- Leandro Saint Hill: soprano & alto saxophones, flute,
- Marque Gilmore: drums.

This concert was co-organized by the [Tourcoing Planètes Jazz Festival][tjf] and the [Jazz en Nord Festival][jen], which organizes events along the year.

## Tuesday: Stefan Orins trio, McCoy Tyner quartet

The trio of [Stefan & Peter Orins and Christophe Hache](http://www.myspace.com/stefanorins) is a very local group; I saw them last year at [La Malterie](http://www.lamalterie.com/), a bar / concert cave / artist residence in Lille, where they regularly [play](http://www.lamalterie.com/fr/evenement/concert/stefan-orins-trio-sortie-de-disque) or collaborate with the resident musicians, in particular in the various projects of [Olivier Benoît](http://obenoitmusic.free.fr/indexbis.htm). They were playing songs from [their next album, Stöt][stot].

- Stefan Orins: piano,
- Christophe Hache: bass,
- Peter Orins: drums.

[![McCoy Tyner Quartet (2008)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/mccoy.jpg)][mccoy]{: .right}

Following them, was some guy that was way to old and too respected by the rest of the audience for me to just discover now: [McCoy Tyner](http://mccoytyner.com/) and his quartet. This was clearly a different class of jazz, much cleaner, polished and refined.
Maybe too much? I have to admit I tend to prefer the youngsters that play Jazz versions of Nirvana songs :)

- McCoy Tyner: piano,
- Gérald Canon: bass,
- Eric Kamau Gravatt: drums,
- Gary Bartz: saxophones.

## Wednesday: Ibrahim Maalouf, Rabih Abou-Khalil

[![Ibrahim Maalouf, Diachronism (2009)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/diachronism.jpg)][aljadida]{: .right}

I already saw [Ibrahim Maalouf](http://www.myspace.com/ibrahimmaalouf) at an open-air festival this summer, but was really happy to have another chance in a smaller setting.
He has lots of fun and energy on stage, and it shows in his music and his contact with the public.

- Ibrahim Maalouf: trumpet,
- Benjamin Molinaro: bass guitar,
- Frank Woeste: fender road,
- Nenad Gajin: guitar,
- Xavier Roge: drums.

[![Rabih Abou-Khalil, Al-Jadida (1991)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/al-jadida.jpg)][aljadida]{: .right}

I knew [Rabih Abou-Khalil](http://www.myspace.com/rabihaboukhalil) from his old works, in particular [_Al Jadida_][aljadida], and his music really touched me.
On stage, he revealed to be a really funny guy, adept of tongue-in-cheek humour, wearing his shirt color-coordinated with the group's tuba (why, yes, a turquoise tuba), and dedicating a song to "this monument of british cuisine, the fish-n-ships". Enlightening.

- Rabih Abou-Khalil: oud,
- Ricardo Ribeiro: vocals, saxophone,
- Luciano Biondini: accordion,
- Michel Godard: tuba, serpent, bass guitar,
- Jarrod Cagwin: drums, percussions.

This concert was filmed and Rabih Abou-Khalil's performance can be watched on [Arte Liveweb](http://liveweb.arte.tv/fr/video/Le_Rabih_Abou-Khalil_Quintet_au_Tourcoing_Jazz_Festival/); Ibrahim Maalouf was also recorded but sadly it does not seem to be online.

## Thursday: Portico quartet, Manu Katché

[![Portico Quartet, Isla (2009)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/isla.jpg)][isla]{: .right}

The discovery: [Portico quartet](http://porticoquartet.com).
They were announced as the recent revelation, and indeed they were a very good surprise.
The [hang]() and electronics come together to create _their_ sonic atmosphere, somewhere between jazz and electro.

- Duncan Bellamy: drums,
- Milo Fitzpatrick: bass,
- Nicholas Mulvey: hang,
- Jack Wyllie: saxophone.

[![Manu Katché, Third Round (2010)](/notes/2010/tourcoing-jazz-festival/third-round.jpg)][thirdround]{: .right}

The disappointment: [Manu Katché](http://www.manu-katche.com/) played with Jan Garbarek or Anouar Brahem, whose music always grabs me from inside, so I had high hopes.
Unfortunately we got clean, consensual jazz, played by good musicians but with too much ease… boring[^talking].

- Manu Katché: drums,
- Petter Wettre: saxophone,
- Alfio Origlio: piano, Fender Rhodes,
- Laurent Vernerey: bass guitar.

[^talking]: Though certainly not that boring to the middle-aged ladies next row, who didn't chat as much as during Portico's set. And then the younger generations get blamed for their lack of manners?
